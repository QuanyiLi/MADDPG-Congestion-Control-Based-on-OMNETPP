# MADDPG-Congestion-Control-Based-on-OMNETPP

Now, the experiment video can be accessed. A simple mehod is downloading them from ExperimentsVideo.zip

Since we use LFS to upload videos, if you want to clone project including videos, use ```git lfs clone``` to pull this repo instead of ```git clone```.

If you only want to access the code, use ```git clone```, and it won't pull videos from LFS.

Source code of algorithm can be accessed. 

The code of .cc files will be released soon. Now you can only access the c++ header files of the TE-Env. 

However, by the compiled MADDPG.exe, you can train your own model ! 

The requirement is ```gym == 0.10.0, tensorflow == 1.2.1, matplotlib and python == 3.6```

The MADDPG algorithm is revised from OpenAI https://github.com/openai/maddpg. Visit their website for more details.
