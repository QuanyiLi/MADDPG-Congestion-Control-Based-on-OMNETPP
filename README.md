# MADDPG-Congestion-Control-Based-on-OMNETPP

Now, the experiment video can be accessed. A simple mehod is downloading them from ExperimentsFolder

Source code will be released soon.

Since we use LFS to upload videos, if you want to clone project including videos, use ```git lfs clone``` to pull this repo instead of ```git clone```.

If you only want to access the code, use ```git clone```, and it won't pull videos from LFS.
